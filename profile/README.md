## Overview
![Technology and Architecture](/img/pimcore-technology-architecture.svg)

## Key Benefits and Advantages
### ‚öí Data Modelling and UI Design at the same Time
No matter if you're dealing with unstructured web documents or structured data for MDM/PIM, you define the
UI design (web documents by a template and structured data with an intuitive graphical editor), Pimcore knows
how to persist the data efficiently and optimized for fast access.

### üéõ Agnostic and Universal Framework for your Data
Due to the framework approach, Pimcore is very flexible and adapts perfectly to your needs. Built on top of
the well-known Symfony Framework you have a solid and modern foundation for your project.

### üöÄ Extensible and huge Symfony Community
Benefit from all existing Symfony Components and Bundles provided by the community or create your own
Bundles to extend your Projects with reusable components.

### üíé Your Digital World consolidated in one Platform
No more API, import/export and synchronization hell between MDM/PIM, E-Commerce, DAM, and your Web-CMS.
All is working seamlessly together, natively ... this is what Pimcore is built for.

### ‚ú®Ô∏è Modern and Intuitive UI
We love good-looking user interfaces, designed to be efficient for daily use and optimized for a great
experience for editors.

## Preview and Demo
### Data Objects
![Pimcore Admin Interface Screenshot PIM/MDM](/img/pimcore-screenshot-3.png)
Manage any structured data based on a predefined data model, either manually or automatically via the APIs. Define the structure and attributes of your objects by using the class editor. Manage any data ‚Äì products (PIM/MDM), categories, customers (CDP), orders (digital commerce), blog articles (DXP/CMS). Data Objects provide the possibility to manage structured data for multiple output channels from a single source. By centralizing data in one place, Pimcore's data objects enable you to achieve better data completeness and data quality, allowing you to create and maintain a consistent, up-to-date customer experience across multiple touchpoints in less time.

### Digital Assets
![Pimcore Admin Interface Screenshot DAM](/img/pimcore-screenshot-2.png)
Assets are the DAM part of Pimcore. Store, manage and organize digital files such as images, videos, PDFs, Word/Excel documents in a folder structure. Preview 200+ file types directly in Pimcore, edit pictures, and enrich files with additional meta-data. Facial recognition for focal points in images is available. Editors only need to maintain one high-resolution version of a file in the system. Pimcore can automatically generate all required output formats for various channels such as commerce, apps, websites. Of course, including comprehensive user management and version control.

### Documents
![Pimcore Admin Interface Screenshot CMS](/img/pimcore-screenshot-1.png)
The DXP/CMS part of Pimcore for managing unstructured content such as the pages of a website and its navigation. Based on Twig templates, documents render physical HTML/CSS pages and provide the capabilities to manage the presentation of data, exactly how customers will experience it. They can be composed by administrators by arranging predefined layout elements. Pimcore documents provide multilingual and multi-site capabilities for websites, including emails and newsletters. Total frontend flexibility enables a perfect blend of content and commerce. You can also use them to create content for offline channels, such as printed catalogs (web-to-print).

#### Demo (Community Edition)
_Admin-URL_ (stable): [https://demo.pimcore.fun/admin/](https://demo.pimcore.fun/admin/)  
_Admin-URL_ (dev): [https://11.x-dev.pimcore.fun/admin/](https://11.x-dev.pimcore.fun/admin/)
